# Portfolio
Check out my portfolio site!

This is a site I started building with HTML and vanilla CSS when I was first getting my feet wet. It has been good practice for learning how to align items in relation to one another, especially Flexbot and CSS Grid. The design is mobile responsive and will scale to the size of the screen it is being viewed on thanks to CSS breakpoints.
